# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on EV Charging Data

## Project Description

This project focuses on the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of electric vehicle (EV) charging behaviors. The aim is to understand patterns and insights related to EV charging using the provided datasets.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   To get started, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tranhlok/EV-charging-behaviors.git
cd EV-charging-behaviors
```
2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended)

Create a new virtual environment by running:


```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows:
  ```bash
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On macOS and Linux:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```


3. **Install Dependencies**

Install the required Python packages with pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


The data processing and visualization code is in the file EDA.ipynb.
